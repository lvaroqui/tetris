# Tetris

This is a very small hobby project implementing the basics of the game "Tetris".

There is no score, hold or queue functionnality. What interested me was discovering SFML, representing the game in an oriented object manner and see what traps could lie along the way.

# Build and Run

Requirements:
- C++17
- SFML

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./Tetris # Run the game
```
